=head1 NAME

B<ponfishr>: Binary Newsreader and Decoder

=head1 USAGE

ponfishr

(There are no options!)

See the ponfish manual.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Ponfishr is the user interface component of Ponfish.  Ponfish
is a newsreader consisting of a client program (ponfishr) and
a command executing daemon (ponfishd).

In order to decode binaries, you will need to install a third-party
yenc or uu decoder.  See I<REQUIREMENTS> below.

=head1 WHAT IS PONFISH?

Ponfish is a binary newsreader that runs in a terminal and
more importantly, runs in Unix.

It is written in Perl.

It can decode binaries (with some help).

It is very efficient.

It is very hard to use.

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

In order to decode binaries, the program "uudeview" must be
installed and in the path.  Uudeview is freely available for
both *nix and Windows.  If you are a Windows user, make sure
you download and install the command-line version into your PATH.

=head1 TO DO

* Manually setting download priorities.

* It would be nice if it could automatically repair downloaded
files - detect errors and the download PAR files as necessary,
do the repair, and finally extract the contents, if it is an
archive.  Note: Doing this would not be overly difficult, but
also not overly easy - a separate thread could run that does
the check periodically, generating PAR download command files
when necessary.

* Curses support to make the interface more intuitive.

* Catch-up and/or tracking of decoded articles or articles
marked as having been read.

* Embedded shell commands in the command files.

* Gathering and displaying of statistics of numbers of posts made
in newsgroups.

* Cleaning out of the junk directory.  Currently completed
commands are moved to this directory.  Should periodically empty
the directory out.

=head1 SEE ALSO

The "user manual" can be accessed by typing:

  > man ponfish

The ponfishd manpage has some related information.
